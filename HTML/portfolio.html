        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>I am a versatile software developer with a strong foundation in Java, SQL, and web development. I have participated in a hackathon to design a mobile application assessing the suitability of coastal tourism sites in India, enhancing my problem-solving and teamwork skills. My experience includes developing an Online Learning Platform with features like course registration, progress tracking, and quiz-taking, leveraging Java and JDBC. I also built an ESP32-based indoor navigation bot to assist individuals with disabilities, using Bluetooth Low Energy for precise navigation. During my OctaNet web development internship, I gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. Additionally, I have developed a health insurance management system in Java, ensuring seamless policy management and claims processing with robust database support</p>
